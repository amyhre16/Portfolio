						<span style="font-size: 130%;">My name is Anthony Myhre. In May 2016, I graduated from The University of Texas at Austin with a degree in Mathematics. While at UT, I also gained certificates in Elements of Computing and Business Foundation. Growing up, I never had an interest in programming. I took my first programming class my third year of college and instantly fell in love. Even though it was too late to switch my major to Computer Science, I was able to gain an Elements of Computing Certificate to help me gain coding experience and fueled my passion for coding.
						<br /><br />
						In my Elements of Computing classes, I learned about Object Oriented Programming (Python, Java), functional programming (JavaScript), HTML, CSS, SQL queries, and relational databases. After graduation, I enrolled in the Coding Bootcamp to expand my coding experience.
						<br /><br />
						At Coding Bootcamp, I have expanded my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as gained new experience in jQuery, Bootstrap, AJAX and APIs, Firebase, and NodeJS. I’ve also been able to expand my group working skills. Because we are required to discuss our class activities, it helps solidify what we have learned. I truly believe that talking out problems and teaching to others helps you to further understand the topic. Doing group projects has helped cement the ability to divide up the work, putting my trust in my groupmates to do an amazing job with their share of the work, and working together when someone runs into a bug in their code or gets stuck.
						<br /><br />
						Even though I do not plan on pursuing a career in Mathematics, the experience I gained with my degree has helped me thrive while learning to code. Although my Math skills do not directly transfer to coding, analytical skills and problem solving are used in every project. To solve a Math problem requires the ability to analyze the problem, identify what the problem is asking for, and decide what the best formula is to solve the problem. This is very similar to problem solving in computer programming. In programming, if you do not plan how you are going to attack the problem before you begin coding, writing your program will be much more difficult.
						<br /><br />
						When I am not coding, I love hanging out with my family and friends. I’ve played video games and sports since I was little. My favorite sports are football, basketball, and baseball. I’ve been lucky enough to attend the Texas – Oklahoma football game for the past five years. My favorite video games are first person shooters, especially Battlefield, and sports games.
